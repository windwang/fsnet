  * Outbox looks like the current page but only shows the sent messages.
http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetNewMessage.PNG

If you want to see the full message, just click on the subject. Moreover, if you were in the "Inbox Page", a "Quick Reponse" button provides you a little text editor already filled with the mail of your contact and the previous subject.

## Contacts ##
This page displays all the links you have with other users of FSNet.
Three tables may be visible at the same time. But, be careful, some may be hidden. It depends on the requests you've sent to other members.
> http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetContact.PNG
  * The first one regroups the users who wish to be your contact. If nobody wants, the table doesn't appear. For each of the requests, you can accept or decline the invitation. You also can send a message (cf. previous part)

  * The second table is the full list of your current contacts. Don't hesitate to send them messages. Of course if you no more want to be the contact of someone, remove him by clicking on the associated button.

  * Finally the last one shows the the users who have not already accepted to be your contact. You can cancel your invitation and as usual send to this person a message.


## Visits ##
Here you can see all the members (not only your contacts) who visited your profile. This information may be very useful if you're currently looking for a job!
http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetVisits.PNG

## Profile ##
You're now on the main page of your profile. It contains all the informations you have entered on the site.

### Main page ###
This is the summary of your profile. On the top, your personnal informations. Just under are your interests, then your last modifications on FSNet, then your current contacts, displayed as a list of miniatures. Finally the group you're belonging is on the bottom of the page.
http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetProfile.PNG

More details on groups and interests are given in their respective parts.

In the left menu, you can modify your profile, your interests, and search all the members in the application (like with the search tool on top).

### "Modify my informations" page ###
The first fragment is a way to make a link between your FSNet Account and the data you've already stored on Facebook. With this tool, you're able to import most of the your personal informations available on Zuckerberg's baby.

The second form gives you the opportunity to change all of your informations. But be careful, all the data you will specify will be visible on your main profile page.
Don't forget that any change in your e-mail address will affect your login informations.

With the middle form you can change your password. Don't make any mistake between the two fields of the new one.

The last one concerns your own picture. You could upload it from a file or from an internet site by entering its URL in the "Internet Link" field. If you want to remove your icon, click on the "delete" link on the right.
http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetEditProfile.PNG


### "Modify my interests" page ###
On this page, you can manage all your interests. If you want to learn things about them, read the next part. All the interests you've already added are listed in the center, just under the menu. The things that no more fascinate you can easily be removed by a simple click on the red button near the name.

Many suggested interests are proposed just after, in small blue rectangles. If you want to join one of them, just click on the green cross.

Once again, a search tool is available in the third part. All the things containing the keyword you're searching will be added under the button.

Thanks to the bottom form, you can easily create one or many interests.
http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/FSNetModifyInterests.PNG

## Interests ##
As you should have understood, the interests are just a list of things you like. They are visible for all the users who take a look at your profile. As an element of a social network, many links can be made between users who appreciate or talk about the same thing.

To get some informations on your favorite subject, just click on it in the green rectangle. Then you'll be able to find everything you want about this stuff. From top to bottom:
  * The parents (about a less specific element)
  * The children (about a more specific element)
  * The related social entities like users, groups, etc. Here you can meet users in love with the same interest. If you'll click on any user, you'll find more informations on them.
  * The communities associated with the current hobby.
  * The Hubs (a gathering of topics)
  * The Topics (a list of messages)
  * All the events refering to what you're looking at.
  * Finally all the announces linked to this interest.

http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetInterests.PNG
In the left menu, two new options are offered. Create an event, or Create an announce. More details can be found in the next parts.

## Consultations ##
Today, most of the social networks provide their users a way to give their opinion.
FSNet also gives you this opportunity. The "Consultations" page is here to answer this need.

On the main page, the top part is the list of all the surveys you've already made. If you want to make a new consultation, take a look at the usual left menu. Read a bit below to obtain more details.

The second part is the classis search tool. Thanks to it, you can find any consultation available in the full list just under the search tool.

So, the bottom fragment regroups all the surveys on which you may access. It can be reduced to a smaller list where only the consultations containing the keywords you're looking for are displayed.
http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetConsultations.PNG
Finally, to create an new poll, you have to fill a precise form. Most of the options are pretty easy to understand. If you want to add choices, just click on the "+" button. Obviously, click on "-" to remove one. You could choose the limit of vote per participant and also a limit per choice so the survey will end when the max is reached.

Currently, only the users in the same group can see the survey. Indeed, there are some troubles with the rights. This feature needs to be improved soon. Then it will be possible to give some groups the opportunity to answer the consultation.

If you prefer to participate and vote, click on a survey title. On this page, you will find on top a part of the options used to make the consultation like for example his owner or the deadline. Then you can see the current status, with the different choices made by users, and finally lays a brief summary of the opinions.
Once you've voted, you could change your answer by clicking the red cross near your own name. This will remove your line.

## Announces ##
more details available soon

## Events ##
As it was said in the part about the interests, you can create an event at a specific date, related to anything you want and in any place.
On the events main page, you can see two main parts.
  * The classic search tool, which provides you help to find any date.
  * The full list you can access, according to your rights.

http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetEvents.PNG
If you click on  a title in the gathering tool, you'll access at the specific event page. Then you may find all the details you want.

For example, thanks to google maps, you can localize the place where your next fest will take place. On the bottom, all the people who have subscribed are displayed. As usual, click on them to reach their profile. Please note that you can delete your own events and subscribe anything you want.

http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetEventTest.PNG
The left menu lets you see the calendar and also an event. The calendar is just a beautiful summary of all the things you've scheduled. Take now a look at the last option.
To create a new meeting for example, you have to fully fill the form on this page. Link your new event with all the interests that you want, and don't forget to add a place, so that google will find you.
The date specification will open a short frame containing a calendar, offering you the opportunity to also choose an hour.

## Communities ##
The final upper menu tool! To be fully functionnal, a social network, such as FSNet, must be able to draw communities. They regroup people sharing the same interests for example. They also gather hubs and messages dealing about the same topics.

http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetCommunity.PNG
You can to choose to follow a community. This will give you the possibility to be aware of everything happening in relation with the main subject.

On this page, the first fragment is about the communities you're already in.
Then you'll find the classic search tool.
Finally are displayed all the communities according to your search options.

http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetCommunities.PNG
Currently there's no way to join a private community. This option will probably be added soon.

# Important features #
The next features are not directly available through a menu but have to be explained.

## Groups ##
Groups can only be made by the admin user in the admin part. If you want to find more informations on their creation, go to the end part.
Groups are a gathering of users who share the same rights or who belong the same firm for example.

As a normal user, you have to communicate with FSNet administrator to change your group. It's not possible to do it yourself.


Of course, groups have a private "boss". This person is considerd by the application as an small  administrator, responsible of his own band. (Some details will be added later on their personal rights). Among these privileges is the ability to make a custom template, following a few conditions described in the next part.
Moreover, anybody can lead different groups. It depends on your will and on administrator rules.

On the main page of a group (reachable by a click on his name anywhere on FSNet), you'll find on top its name preceded by its parent separated by a chevron. Then follow a brief description and its sons. At the end are all the members belonging to the group you're looking at.

http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetGroup.PNG
In this exemple, "Université d'Artois" has 4 sons, no parent and 2 members.

## Permissions (and groups...) ##
Groups and permissions are really close in term of meaning and use. There are two big types:
  * The classic group: A list of users with the same rights, belonging to another parent group.
  * The parent-less group: It's like a super group, which defines the entities (like a company or a university). For each of them, a custom template can be used on FSNet. To be more precise, if you belong to one of these groups, you can use a different style on the FSNet web interface. These changes can be made by the group administrator. Currently, this featured is not implemented. The only way to customize the site is the main logo in the right corner, which can be changed in the "admin part". It will be available in a close future.

So, if you want to use a customized template or get some bonus rights, just change your group or contact the administrator to do it!


# The "admin" part #

At first to acces this part, you will need to login as the administrator. Use "admin" as password and user name.

## Home page ##
After this short step, you will be able to enjoy your administrator role. The page you should see now is the Home page of this second smaller application. Contrary to the classic FSNet, this document doesn't provide a lot of informations. Indeed, it's not even possible to do anything on this page except reading!

As in the Web application, you can use two menus: one on the left and the other on top. With The left menu you'll be able to create a member or group, and the uppper one gives your more rights and options.
![http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminMP.png](http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminMP.png)

## Create ##
If you want to create a social Entity, click on this button!

### Create a member ###
Your main privilege is the ability to create (and so invite...) anyone you want on the public user part of FSNet. To do it, fill the form you'll find after clicking the link "create" on top.
Just a few informations are necessary to make a new member:
  * Last name
  * First name
  * an email adress

You don't have to provide a password thanks to the password generator. In this case, an email containing the basic informations will be sent to the mail adress you've specified. Obviously, if you've decided to use the generator, you won't have any idea of what it will be. However if you prefer to specify a default password, don't let the two bottom fields empty.
Moreover, to add a particular text to the default mail, write it in the area above the validate button. The sentences around show you the full message.

![http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminCreateMember.png](http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminCreateMember.png)

You should have noticed that you don't have specified any private information while creating the new member. It's the new user itself who will provide them later in its profile.
If you do not specify any group to your new invited, it won't have any right and particulary it won't be able to change its profile. So, if you want to learn more about how to manage groups and rights, go to the section below.


### Create several members ###

Obviously, if you want to create thousand users, it will be very long. Hopefully, FSNet provides you a tool to create someone more easily.
Just clik on the white button at the top of the page close to "Create several members". This will change the previous form.

You're now facing a big text area where to briefly describe the people you want to enroll.

To be fully efficient, you have to follow a particular syntax. But don't be afraid, it's really easy.
It's explained just above! You have to put 3 informations per line and per user, separated by "/". It must be Name/FirstName/Email. You could find an example in the next screenshot.
![http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminMultiMembers.png](http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminMultiMembers.png)

You've probably realized that you don't have specified any password for the new members. Indeed, in this case, it's necessary made by the generator.
If you've finished your new users, click on "Validate" at the bottom. Then an email will be sent to all the mail adresses you've entered in the upper text area. It will contain all the required informations to login on FSNet such as the adress and the generated password.
Please note that you can't specify any group with this mode of creation. So all people won't even have the most basic rights.


### Create a group ###
Now your instance of FSNet should contain users, no matter if they were created by the most precise form or by the fastest. You may want to link them through a specific feature: the groups!

First of all, you have to create a group! Don't be afraid by the huge form, it's quite easy to fill it.
A name has to be specified. If you want, you can add a small description that will be visible by everyone.
The third element is the parent's group. As it was explained in a previous part, a group without parent is like a "super group", defining a particular socialEntity like a firm or a university. In a close future, it will also be possible to use a custom template for the application into this group.
The fourth input deals with the owner of a group. This person will have some particular rights on it. Anybody may be the manager of any group and all the users can lead different groups. Currently, only one leader per group is allowed.

Then you could add or remove all the users you want to your current group. In this are only diplayed the group less users. It's in fact not possible to subscribe many groups at the same time. So if you want add a member who is not available in the left list, you should firstly remove it from its current social entity. You could select many persons in the left area and move them to the right by a simple click on the arrow button oriented to the right. Obviously, you can remove them by selecting them on right and click on the other arrow between the two fields.
The penultimate field is about the group under your current one (ie: these groups will have the one you're making as parent). Here again only the free group are available. Use the same buttons to move them from left to right and vice versa.
The last input is used to edit the rights belonging to the subscribers. Here you will be able give all the permissions you want to a particular group. Here is the list and the details:
  * send a message: send a message trough the inbox to another user
  * receive a message: read the messages received in the inbox
  * answer a message: use the "quick response" system and keep the topic alive along the discuss
  * add a contact to the group: the possibility to invite someone into your current group
  * remove a contact to the group: have the ability to exluce someone of your current group
  * modify profile: the right to edit the informations place in your profile
  * modify a picture: the right to change your picture
  * add an event: create an event into the group (only visible for the group uers)
  * register an event: subscribe to an event
  * add a consultation: allow someone to create a survey
  * add an announce: create an announce related to your group
  * create a community: create a community and its hubs linked to your group

Don't forget to click on validate once it's finished!

## Members ##
If you're looking for a particular user, the search tool provided in the uppert fragment will be very useful. Use it just exactly as the one in the FSNet classic part.

![http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminMembers.png](http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminMembers.png)

If you click on a member in the below list, you will be able to modify its profile. Then change everything you want such as the lost mail adress of a user or its town. It's exactly the same form in the creation. Unfortunately (or hopefully?) it's not possible to change the password or the picture of a member. So it will necerrasy have to find the mail adress used to register its account.

Obviously, you can change the group of everybody. This will change the default rights given by FSNet.

![http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminEditMember.png](http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminEditMember.png)

## Groups ##
That's exactly the same page with the members but this one deals with the groups. So you will find the classic search tool and the results list.

To edit a group or its content, click on its name and you will be able to use the creation form already filled with the informations previously entered while you decided to create it. Don't forget that only the free social entities are displayed in the lists on the modification page.


## Announces ##
As usual, you will find all the announces created and the search tool to find something particular. You don't have the right to edit any of them or even to create one.

## Events ##
To retrieve all the events created in FSNet, go to this page! The search tool will help you to find or filter anything you want.

![http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminEvent.png](http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminEvent.png)

If you click on the name of an event, you will be able to find more specific informations such as the members that have subscribed or the location. Please note that you're also able to delete them just because you're the administrator. However, you can't create a meeting because of the rights troubles between groups.

## Communities ##
It's the page where you can do anything you want with communities.

The first part provides you a tool to quickly create a community. Just write its name and choose the owner you want. Once again, a unique member can be responsible of several communities.

Thanks to the second fragment you can rename a community. Simply choose the one you want and give it its new name.

As usual The two last tools are linked. The search tool can reduce the list of the communities provided at the bottom with the keywords you've put. Contrary to the other pages, you can't acces to the informations of a community by clicking on its name but if you've really read

![http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminCommunity.png](http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminCommunity.png)



## Interets ##
If you want to manage the interests of your application, you have to go on this page!
This time the search tool is the first on the top. If you want more details on it, fall back to the previous part. To get more details on a specific interest, click on its name. Then you'll arrive on the same page as the one on FSNet lambda user part.

To create a new thing, use the second fragment. You can put several interests at the same time, seperated by a ";". It's also possible to add a parent, use the input on the left of the text field.


If you prefer to change an already created interet, select it in the third part. Then you may change its name or its parent.

Finally, to delete something, select it at the bottom and click the "delete" button.
![http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminEditInterests.png](http://wiki.fsnet.googlecode.com/git/screenshots/FSNetAdminEditInterests.png)

## Configuration ##

Here is your the last part of the Administrator application.
In upper form you can configure your own smtp sever, using or not an authenfication system. It's also possible to use a particular cryptographic protocol such as SSL or TLS. The two last options are the site public URL (which depends on your host), and the folder where uploaded picutres and data will be stored. Check your server if you want more details.

The Facebook key is the link between FSNet and the most famous social network. You should have seen in the common part that it's possible to import your informations from facebook. This key provides the autorisation to get these data.

The third option is only useful in case where your instance of FSNet is a bit old. In previous versions, it was possible to register your mail adress with a capital letter. Later, the case sensitivity has been removed and you have to remove all the capital letters in the older databases to let people a way to access after migrating if they had a capital letter in their adresses.

Finally the last one is the way to test the correct deployment of your application and your SMTP server by sending a test mail to a particular user.
