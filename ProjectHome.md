**About this project**

The aim of this project is to develop a social network application using Java/JEE technology to connect the members of a specific structure, such as a company or a faculty.

In contrast with current social networking applications, the membership is limited to the sole members of the structures or some people invited by those members.

This project is being developed by [4th and 5th year](http://www.cril.fr/master/) computer science students of [Artois University](http://www.univ-artois.fr) during their curriculum.
