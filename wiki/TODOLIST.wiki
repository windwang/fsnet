#Things to do for the next release of FSNET

Add your feature requests here.

==Functional requests==

  * Improved installation experience (embedded DB if none installed)
In the current scheme, we require a datasource to be set and properly installed to run FSNET. It means that it is not that easy to try. It might be a good idea to have a way to deploy an embedded DB to allow people to give by simply deploying the war, or using a built in jetty.

  * Introduce authorization management
Everybody can see everything. The notion of groups is not implemented. This is a very important feature missing before the application can really be deployed in a company.

  * Mobile clients (Android and iPhone support)
  * Multi firms online version

==Technical requests==

  * New module dedicated to mobile clients that expose restful+json services
